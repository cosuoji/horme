    bio: `John Saviours Udomboso, globally recognized as Young Jonn or 'The HITmaker,' is a trailblazing force in the Afro-pop and Afrobeats music scene.

    Following a pivotal move to Lagos in 2012, his production genius propelled him into the mainstream with chart-topping hits like 'Mafo' by Naira Marley, 'ShakitiBobo' and 'Story for the Gods' by Olamide, as well as, 'Don't Call Me' by Lil Kesh.
    
    His discography boasts an impressive roster of A-list artists, including Davido, Tiwa Savage, and Kizz Daniel. With three Nigerian Entertainment Awards for Producer of the Year and countless nominations, his impact on the industry is undeniable.
    
    Beyond production, Young Jonn's talent as a singer and songwriter has flourished. In 2021, he signed with Chocolate City Music, a strategic move that propelled him to superstardom. His debut project, Love Is Not Enough, released in April 2022, marked a significant milestone in his career scoring a remix to his first single 'Dada' with popular Afrobeats artist, Davido. This was followed by Love Is Not Enough Vol. 2. In 2024, he released his long-awaited debut album, Jiggy Forever.
    
    Touted to be his best body of work yet, Jiggy Forever is a valuable addition to his track record. The album boasts of anthems like â€œBig Big Things'' featuring Seyi Vibes and Kizz Daniel, Aquafina, Sharpally, and Stronger. With a string of hits and a growing global fanbase, Young Jonn continues to redefine the boundaries of Afrobeats.` ,
